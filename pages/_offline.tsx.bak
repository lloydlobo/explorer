// Offline Fallbacks
//
// Offline fallbacks are useful when the fetch failed from both cache and network, a precached resource is served instead of present an error from browser.
//
// To get started simply add a /_offline page such as pages/_offline.js or pages/_offline.jsx or pages/_offline.ts or pages/_offline.tsx. Then you are all set! When the user is offline, all pages which are not cached will fallback to '/_offline'.

import Head from "next/head";

    </Head>
    <h1>This is offline fallback page</h1>
    <h2>When offline, any page route will fallback to this page</h2>
